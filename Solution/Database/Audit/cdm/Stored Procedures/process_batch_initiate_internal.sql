OBJECT: cdm.process_batch_initiate_internal

DESCRIPTION: Given a Data Management Process UID this procedure initiates a new process batch, automatically
  applying the Internal Sequence Indicator = 1.

PARAMETERS:

  @process_uid  = Text that uniquely identifies the Data Management process.

  @channel_uid = The channel through which this data came into the system. Typically not specified. May be
    used when data comes in on file feeds (channel = file name) or when there are multiple source system instances
    loaded through a single workflow.

  @scope = Text that may be used for analysis of process data, often used to group processes.
 
  @workflow_name = Name of the workflow (encapsulated code) that executes the process.
 
  @workflow_guid VARCHAR(100) = Unique identifier of the workflow (encapsulated code) that executes the process.
 
  @workflow_version VARCHAR(20) = Version of the workflow (encapsulated code) that executes the process.
  
  @limit_process_uid VARCHAR(50) Optional = Identifier of a Data Management Process whose End Sequence Key is used to limit the
    returned End Sequence Key of the primary process.  The lesser of the two End Sequence Keys is returned.

  @comments VARCHAR(200) Optional = Comments to be applied to the new process batch.
  
OUTPUT PARAMETERS: None.
  
RETURN VALUE:

  batch_key INT = Key identifying the new process batch.

RETURN DATASET:

  NOTE: Only a single record will be returned.

  batch_key INT = Key identifying the new process batch.
  initiate_dtm DATETIME = Datetime the process batch was initiated.
  initiate_dtm_text CHAR(23) = Text representation of the Initiated Datetime, having the format CONVERT(char(23),<<datetime>>,121)
  begin_sequence_val BIGINT = Integer value representing the start of the range to be considered in processing the batch.
  begin_sequence_dtm DATETIME = Datetime value representing the start of the range to be considered in processing the batch.
  begin_sequence_dtm_text CHAR(23) = Text representation of the Start Sequence Datetime, having the format CONVERT(char(23),<<datetime>>,121)
  end_sequence_val BIGINT = Integer value representing the end of the range to be considered in processing the batch.
  end_sequence_dtm DATETIME = Datetime value representing the end of the range to be considered in processing the batch.
  end_sequence_dtm_text CHAR(23) = Text representation of the End Sequence Datetime, having the format CONVERT(char(23),<<datetime>>,121)
